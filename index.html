        <h2>Origins</h2>
       <p>  When future archeologists unearth the ruins of this place they find themselves in an academic debate. One school will argue that it was a penal colony, because there is evidence of barbarism, brutality and psycological isolation. Another school will hypothesize that it was a military installation, based on the uniform conformity and number of weapons they find. They will agree, however that no one would EVER live in such a sterile and vacuous place on purpose. This place is found on edge of Detroit. Now he lives in the PNW with his family, they have two cats and no dogs.</p>
