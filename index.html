        <h2>Origins</h2>

       <p>  Imagine, ten thousand years into the future. Two renowned Archeologists have returned from a dig, what they found was disturbing a combination of brutality and primitivsm. One will hypothesize  that the evidence of  unquestioning obedience, xenophobia and psycological isolation can mean only one thing: A 20th century penal colony. </p>
       <p>  The other will argue that it was not a penal colony at all, but infact a military camp for insolent conscripts. </p>
         <p> They will agree, however on one thing: No one would EVER choose such a sterile and flavorless existence. This place is found on edge of Detroit, it is where this guy was born. It took him 19 years to escape. He now lives in the PNW with his family, they have two cats and no dogs. </p>

        <div id="skills">
          <h2>Skills and Accomplishments</h2>
          <p> So this guy can do some stuff, since escaping the point of origin he has been engaged in a variety of occupations. From vegan baker to Army Cavalry Scout to bike courier to Uber driver.
